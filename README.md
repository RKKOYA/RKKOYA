## ðŸŽŠ GRADUATED SUMMER 2024 BS CS @ UCF!!


## :book: What I have learned at UCF

* [DONE!] **Discrete Structures II**
  * I have learned the foundations of computation and the theory behind it. I have always felt that this class would be very difficult and boring but it turns out that there is a lot going on in this area and is great to explore the limits of what computers can do.
* [DONE!] **Matrix & Linear Algebra**
  * This class allowed me to learn about how vectors and matrices can be pushed to solve complex problems and how they set up the foundations of AI. I never knew that just how much you can do with them and how much of an impact they can be.
* [DONE!] **The Enjoyment of Music**
  * The oddball for my semester but required regardless. I enjoyed understanding the fundamentals of music and its history over the years. I actually enjoyed understanding how and why music was praised back then and the influence they spread around the world.

* [DONE!] **Introduction to Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering**
  * This introduces me to various tools that are used to analyze malware at a static/dynamic level. I was always the paranoid type when it comes to knowing if my computer was infected and so this class allows me to not only know what happens to a computer when it is infected with malware but also to help better secure devices for others.
* [DONE!] **Programming Languages**
  * A class that introduces various programming languages (Haskell, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, C#). I have always wanted to learn C++ as I have learned how to use C very early on in my academic career and found it to be solid programming language. I would like to expand on this language since I still learn new things about it to this day.
* [DONE!] **Enterprise Computing**
  * I am taking this class to learn how Java is used by so many organizations and understand GUI application development. My last project involved me connecting my Java application to a MySQL database and submitting queries from various client users from the frontend.
* [DONE!] **Senior Design II**
  * The big one! This is my capstone course at UCF and it is where the research and time spent planning in Senior Design I is being put into motion. This is where my sponsor gets to see how we develop their solution and perform numerous presentations on our work.
